# cassinidev
The goal of the CassiniDev project is to provide an open platform for developing a robust ASP.Net web server implementation that addresses many of the limitations and difficulties encountered when using Cassini and/or Visual Studio Development Server.

CassiniDev is packaged as a standalone WinForms GUI application, a console application and library assembly suitable for self hosting and in automated testing scenarios including continuous integration and as a 100% compatible drop-in replacement for the Visual Studio 2008/2010 development server.
